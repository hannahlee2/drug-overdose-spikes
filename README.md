# Uncovering Patterns in Overdose Deaths: An Analysis of Spike Identification in Fatal Drug Overdose Data

This repository contains codes for the algorithm in detecting spikes, sensitivity analysis across varying parameters, and creating visualization.

We implemented and modified the algorithm from [Robust peak detection algorithm (using z-scores)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22583391/peak-signal-detection-in-realtime-timeseries-data/22640362#22640362) in R.

We utilize data containing daily counts of fatal overdoses.
